Simply install it with ``pip``::\n\n    $ pip install certifi\n\nUsage\n-----\n\nTo reference the installed certificate authority (CA) bundle, you can use the\nbuilt-in function::\n\n    >>> import certifi\n\n    >>> certifi.where()\n    '/usr/local/lib/python3.7/site-packages/certifi/cacert.pem'\n\nOr from the command line::\n\n    $ python -m certifi\n    /usr/local/lib/python3.7/site-packages/certifi/cacert.pem\n\nEnjoy!\n\n.. _`Requests`: https://requests.readthedocs.io/en/master/\n\nAddition/Removal of Certificates\n--------------------------------\n\nCertifi does not support any addition/removal or other modification of the\nCA trust store content.

Here are some numbers.\n\n| Package                                       | Accuracy | Mean per file (ms) | File per sec (est) |\n|-----------------------------------------------|:--------:|:------------------:|:------------------:|\n| [chardet](https://github.com/chardet/chardet) |   86 %   |       200 ms       |     5 file/sec     |\n| charset-normalizer                            | **98 %** |     **10 ms**      |    100 file/sec    |\n\n| Package                                       | 99th percentile | 95th percentile | 50th percentile |\n|-----------------------------------------------|:---------------:|:---------------:|:---------------:|\n| [chardet](https://github.com/chardet/chardet) |     1200 ms     |     287 ms      |      23 ms      |\n| charset-normalizer                            |     100 ms      |      50 ms      |      5 ms       |\n\nChardet's performance on larger file (1MB+) are very poor. Expect huge difference on large payload.\n\n> Stats are generated using 400+ files using default parameters. More details on used files, see GHA workflows.\n> And yes, these results might change at any time. The dataset can be updated to include more files.\n> The actual delays heavily depends on your CPU capabilities. The factors should remain the same.\n> Keep in mind that the stats are generous and that Chardet accuracy vs our is measured using Chardet initial capability\n> (eg. Supported Encoding) Challenge-them if you want.\n\n## ✨ Installation\n\nUsing PyPi for latest stable\n```sh\npip install charset-normalizer -U\n```\n\n## 🚀 Basic Usage\n\n### CLI\nThis package comes with a CLI.\n\n```\nusage: normalizer [-h] [-v] [-a] [-n] [-m] [-r] [-f] [-t THRESHOLD]\n                  file [file ...]\n\nThe Real First Universal Charset Detector.

Disabling\n                        JSON output.\n  -r, --replace         Replace file when trying to normalize it instead of\n                        creating a new one.\n  -f, --force           Replace file without asking if you are sure, use this\n                        flag with caution.\n  -t THRESHOLD, --threshold THRESHOLD\n                        Define a custom maximum amount of chaos allowed in\n                        decoded content. 0. <= chaos <= 1.\n  --version             Show version information and exit.\n```\n\n```bash\nnormalizer ./data/sample.1.fr.srt\n```\n\n:tada: Since version 1.4.0 the CLI produce easily usable stdout result in JSON format.\n\n```json\n{\n    \"path\": \"/home/default/projects/charset_normalizer/data/sample.1.fr.srt\",\n    \"encoding\": \"cp1252\",\n    \"encoding_aliases\": [\n        \"1252\",\n        \"windows_1252\"\n    ],\n    \"alternative_encodings\": [\n        \"cp1254\",\n        \"cp1256\",\n        \"cp1258\",\n        \"iso8859_14\",\n        \"iso8859_15\",\n        \"iso8859_16\",\n        \"iso8859_3\",\n        \"iso8859_9\",\n        \"latin_1\",\n        \"mbcs\"\n    ],\n    \"language\": \"French\",\n    \"alphabets\": [\n        \"Basic Latin\",\n        \"Latin-1 Supplement\"\n    ],\n    \"has_sig_or_bom\": false,\n    \"chaos\": 0.149,\n    \"coherence\": 97.152,\n    \"unicode_path\": null,\n    \"is_preferred\": true\n}\n```\n\n### Python\n*Just print out normalized text*\n```python\nfrom charset_normalizer import from_path\n\nresults = from_path('./my_subtitle.srt')\n\nprint(str(results.best()))\n```\n\n*Upgrade your code without effort*\n```python\nfrom charset_normalizer import detect\n```\n\nThe above code will behave the same as **chardet**. We ensure that we offer the best (reasonable) BC result possible.\n\nSee the docs for advanced usage : [readthedocs.io](https://charset-normalizer.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)\n\n## 😇 Why\n\nWhen I started using Chardet, I noticed that it was not suited to my expectations, and I wanted to propose a\nreliable alternative using a completely different method. Also! I never back down on a good challenge!\n\nI **don't care** about the **originating charset** encoding, because **two different tables** can\nproduce **two identical rendered string.**\nWhat I want is to get readable text, the best I can. \n\nIn a way, **I'm brute forcing text decoding.** How cool is that ? 😎\n\nDon't confuse package **ftfy** with charset-normalizer or chardet. ftfy goal is to repair unicode string whereas charset-normalizer to convert raw file in unknown encoding to unicode.\n\n## 🍰 How\n\n  - Discard all charset encoding table that could not fit the binary content.\n  - Measure noise, or the mess once opened (by chunks) with a corresponding charset encoding.\n  - Extract matches with the lowest mess detected.\n  - Additionally, we measure coherence / probe for a language.\n\n**Wait a minute**, what is noise/mess and coherence according to **YOU ?**\n\n*Noise :* I opened hundred of text files, **written by humans**, with the wrong encoding table. **I observed**, then\n**I established** some ground rules about **what is obvious** when **it seems like** a mess.\n I know that my interpretation of what is noise is probably incomplete, feel free to contribute in order to\n improve or rewrite it.\n\n*Coherence :* For each language there is on earth, we have computed ranked letter appearance occurrences (the best we can). So I thought\nthat intel is worth something here. So I use those records against decoded text to check if I can detect intelligent design.\n\n## ⚡ Known limitations\n\n  - Language detection is unreliable when text contains two or more languages sharing identical letters. (eg. HTML (english tags) + Turkish content (Sharing Latin characters))\n  - Every charset detector heavily depends on sufficient content. In common cases, do not bother run detection on very tiny content.\n\n## ⚠️ About Python EOLs\n\n**If you are running:**\n\n- Python >=2.7,<3.5: Unsupported\n- Python 3.5: charset-normalizer < 2.1\n- Python 3.6: charset-normalizer < 3.1\n\nUpgrade your Python interpreter as soon as possible.\n\n## 👤 Contributing\n\nContributions, issues and feature requests are very much welcome.<br />\nFeel free to check [issues page](https://github.com/ousret/charset_normalizer/issues) if you want to contribute.\n\n## 📝 License\n\nCopyright © [Ahmed TAHRI @Ousret](https://github.com/Ousret).<br />\nThis project is [MIT](https://github.com/Ousret/charset_normalizer/blob/master/LICENSE) licensed.\n\nCharacters frequencies used in this project © 2012 [Denny Vrandečić](http://simia.net/letters/)\n\n## 💼 For Enterprise\n\nProfessional support for charset-normalizer is available as part of the [Tidelift\nSubscription][1].

        "description": "Internationalized Domain Names in Applications (IDNA)\n=====================================================\n\nSupport for the Internationalized Domain Names in\nApplications (IDNA) protocol as specified in `RFC 5891\n<https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5891>`_. This is the latest version of\nthe protocol and is sometimes referred to as “IDNA 2008”.\n\nThis library also provides support for Unicode Technical\nStandard 46, `Unicode IDNA Compatibility Processing\n<https://unicode.org/reports/tr46/>`_.\n\nThis acts as a suitable replacement for the “encodings.idna”\nmodule that comes with the Python standard library, but which\nonly supports the older superseded IDNA specification (`RFC 3490\n<https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3490>`_).\n\nBasic functions are simply executed:\n\n.. code-block:: pycon\n\n    >>> import idna\n    >>> idna.encode('ドメイン.テスト')\n    b'xn--eckwd4c7c.xn--zckzah'\n    >>> print(idna.decode('xn--eckwd4c7c.xn--zckzah'))\n    ドメイン.テスト\n\n\nInstallation\n------------\n\nThis package is available for installation from PyPI:\n\n.. code-block:: bash\n\n    $ python3 -m pip install idna\n\n\nUsage\n-----\n\nFor typical usage, the ``encode`` and ``decode`` functions will take a\ndomain name argument and perform a conversion to A-labels or U-labels\nrespectively.\n\n.. code-block:: pycon\n\n    >>> import idna\n    >>> idna.encode('ドメイン.テスト')\n    b'xn--eckwd4c7c.xn--zckzah'\n    >>> print(idna.decode('xn--eckwd4c7c.xn--zckzah'))\n    ドメイン.テスト\n\nYou may use the codec encoding and decoding methods using the\n``idna.codec`` module:\n\n.. code-block:: pycon\n\n    >>> import idna.codec\n    >>> print('домен.испытание'.encode('idna'))\n    b'xn--d1acufc.xn--80akhbyknj4f'\n    >>> print(b'xn--d1acufc.xn--80akhbyknj4f'.decode('idna'))\n    домен.испытание\n\nConversions can be applied at a per-label basis using the ``ulabel`` or\n``alabel`` functions if necessary:\n\n.. code-block:: pycon\n\n    >>> idna.alabel('测试')\n    b'xn--0zwm56d'\n\nCompatibility Mapping (UTS #46)\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\n\nAs described in `RFC 5895 <https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5895>`_, the\nIDNA specification does not normalize input from different potential\nways a user may input a domain name. This functionality, known as\na “mapping”, is considered by the specification to be a local\nuser-interface issue distinct from IDNA conversion functionality.\n\nThis library provides one such mapping, that was developed by the\nUnicode Consortium. Known as `Unicode IDNA Compatibility Processing\n<https://unicode.org/reports/tr46/>`_, it provides for both a regular\nmapping for typical applications, as well as a transitional mapping to\nhelp migrate from older IDNA 2003 applications.\n\nFor example, “Königsgäßchen” is not a permissible label as *LATIN\nCAPITAL LETTER K* is not allowed (nor are capital letters in general).\nUTS 46 will convert this into lower case prior to applying the IDNA\nconversion.\n\n.. code-block:: pycon\n\n    >>> import idna\n    >>> idna.encode('Königsgäßchen')\n    ...\n    idna.core.InvalidCodepoint: Codepoint U+004B at position 1 of 'Königsgäßchen' not allowed\n    >>> idna.encode('Königsgäßchen', uts46=True)\n    b'xn--knigsgchen-b4a3dun'\n    >>> print(idna.decode('xn--knigsgchen-b4a3dun'))\n    königsgäßchen\n\nTransitional processing provides conversions to help transition from\nthe older 2003 standard to the current standard. For example, in the\noriginal IDNA specification, the *LATIN SMALL LETTER SHARP S* (ß) was\nconverted into two *LATIN SMALL LETTER S* (ss), whereas in the current\nIDNA specification this conversion is not performed.\n\n.. code-block:: pycon\n\n    >>> idna.encode('Königsgäßchen', uts46=True, transitional=True)\n    'xn--knigsgsschen-lcb0w'\n\nImplementors should use transitional processing with caution, only in\nrare cases where conversion from legacy labels to current labels must be\nperformed (i.e. IDNA implementations that pre-date 2008). For typical\napplications that just need to convert labels, transitional processing\nis unlikely to be beneficial and could produce unexpected incompatible\nresults.\n\n``encodings.idna`` Compatibility\n++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\n\nFunction calls from the Python built-in ``encodings.idna`` module are\nmapped to their IDNA 2008 equivalents using the ``idna.compat`` module.\nSimply substitute the ``import`` clause in your code to refer to the new\nmodule name.\n\nExceptions\n----------\n\nAll errors raised during the conversion following the specification\nshould raise an exception derived from the ``idna.IDNAError`` base\nclass.\n\nMore specific exceptions that may be generated as ``idna.IDNABidiError``\nwhen the error reflects an illegal combination of left-to-right and\nright-to-left characters in a label; ``idna.InvalidCodepoint`` when\na specific codepoint is an illegal character in an IDN label (i.e.\nINVALID); and ``idna.InvalidCodepointContext`` when the codepoint is\nillegal based on its positional context (i.e. it is CONTEXTO or CONTEXTJ\nbut the contextual requirements are not satisfied.)\n\nBuilding and Diagnostics\n------------------------\n\nThe IDNA and UTS 46 functionality relies upon pre-calculated lookup\ntables for performance. These tables are derived from computing against\neligibility criteria in the respective standards. These tables are\ncomputed using the command-line script ``tools/idna-data``.\n\nThis tool will fetch relevant codepoint data from the Unicode repository\nand perform the required calculations to identify eligibility. There are\nthree main modes:\n\n* ``idna-data make-libdata``. Generates ``idnadata.py`` and\n  ``uts46data.py``, the pre-calculated lookup tables using for IDNA and\n  UTS 46 conversions. Implementors who wish to track this library against\n  a different Unicode version may use this tool to manually generate a\n  different version of the ``idnadata.py`` and ``uts46data.py`` files.\n\n* ``idna-data make-table``. Generate a table of the IDNA disposition\n  (e.g. PVALID, CONTEXTJ, CONTEXTO) in the format found in Appendix\n  B.1 of RFC 5892 and the pre-computed tables published by `IANA\n  <https://www.iana.org/>`_.\n\n* ``idna-data U+0061``. Prints debugging output on the various\n  properties associated with an individual Unicode codepoint (in this\n  case, U+0061), that are used to assess the IDNA and UTS 46 status of a\n  codepoint. This is helpful in debugging or analysis.\n\nThe tool accepts a number of arguments, described using ``idna-data\n-h``. Most notably, the ``--version`` argument allows the specification\nof the version of Unicode to use in computing the table data. For\nexample, ``idna-data --version 9.0.0 make-libdata`` will generate\nlibrary data against Unicode 9.0.0.\n\n\nAdditional Notes\n----------------\n\n* **Packages**. The latest tagged release version is published in the\n  `Python Package Index <https://pypi.org/project/idna/>`_.\n\n* **Version support**. This library supports Python 3.5 and higher.\n  As this library serves as a low-level toolkit for a variety of\n  applications, many of which strive for broad compatibility with older\n  Python versions, there is no rush to remove older intepreter support.\n  Removing support for older versions should be well justified in that the\n  maintenance burden has become too high.\n\n* **Python 2**. Python 2 is supported by version 2.x of this library.\n  While active development of the version 2.x series has ended, notable\n  issues being corrected may be backported to 2.x. Use \"idna<3\" in your\n  requirements file if you need this library for a Python 2 application.\n\n* **Testing**. The library has a test suite based on each rule of the\n  IDNA specification, as well as tests that are provided as part of the\n  Unicode Technical Standard 46, `Unicode IDNA Compatibility Processing\n  <https://unicode.org/reports/tr46/>`_.\n\n* **Emoji**. It is an occasional request to support emoji domains in\n  this library. Encoding of symbols like emoji is expressly prohibited by\n  the technical standard IDNA 2008 and emoji domains are broadly phased\n  out across the domain industry due to associated security risks. For\n  now, applications that wish need to support these non-compliant labels\n  may wish to consider trying the encode/decode operation in this library\n  first, and then falling back to using `encodings.idna`. See `the Github\n  project <https://github.com/kjd/idna/issues/18>`_ for more discussion.\n\n"
