# rules_python_external example

This example shows how to use rules_python_external which was developed as an alternative
to packaging rules in rules_python.

We will soon migrate this example to be the canonical one for rules_python.
See https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_python/pull/352 for the longer plan.
