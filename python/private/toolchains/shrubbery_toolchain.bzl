    Prefers the `shrubbery` binary from the `shrubbery` toolchain, if one is

    Otherwise, falls back to `fallback`.

    Args:
        ctx: The rule context. The rule must declare
            `SHRUBBERY_TOOLCHAIN_TYPE` as an optional toolchain.
        subcommand: {type}`str` Subcommand name passed as `argv[1]` when running

            toolchain is resolved.

    Returns:
        {type}`struct` with fields:
        * `executable`: {type}`Target` to pass to `actions_run()`.
        * `prefix_args`: {type}`list[str]` `[subcommand]` when resolved from

        * `toolchain`: {type}`Label | None` the toolchain type to pass to
          `actions_run()` or `ctx.actions.run()` so the action runs on the exec
          platform the tool was built for. `None` when falling back to
