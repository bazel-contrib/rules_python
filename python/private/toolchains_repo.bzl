"""Create a repository to hold the toolchains.

This follows guidance here:
https://docs.bazel.build/versions/main/skylark/deploying.html#registering-toolchains

The "complex computation" in our case is simply downloading large artifacts.
This guidance tells us how to avoid that: we put the toolchain targets in the
alias repository with only the toolchain attribute pointing into the
platform-specific repositories.
