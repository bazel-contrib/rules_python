A macro to generate an console_script py_binary from reading the 'entry_points.txt'.

We can specifically request the console_script to be running with e.g. Python 3.9:
```starlark
load("@python_versions//3.9:defs.bzl", "py_console_script_binary")

py_console_script_binary(
    name = "yamllint",
    pkg = "@pip//yamllint",
    # yamllint does not have any other scripts except 'yamllint' so the
    # user does not have to specify which console script we should chose from
    # the package.
)
```

Or just use the default version:
```starlark
load("@rules_python//python/entry_points:py_console_script_binary.bzl", "py_console_script_binary")

py_console_script_binary(
    name = "pylint",
    pkg = "@pip//pylint",
    # Because `pylint` has multiple console_scripts available, we have to
    # specify which we want
    script = "pylint",
    deps = [
        # One can add extra dependencies to the entry point.
        # This specifically allows us to add plugins to pylint.
        "@pip//pylint_print",
    ],
)
```

load("//python/private:py_console_script_binary.bzl", _py_console_script_binary = "py_console_script_binary")

py_console_script_binary = _py_console_script_binary
